                <p>Brewer’s yeast is added, and instantly, the yeast begins converting the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This is what makes beer carbonated. Different strains of yeast have different flavor compounds, so this is also where beers get their different and distinct flavor profiles.</p>
