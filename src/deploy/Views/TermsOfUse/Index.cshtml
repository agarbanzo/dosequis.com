          <li><strong>Products: </strong>	The Services may make available listings, descriptions and images of goods or services or related coupons or discounts (collectively, <strong>“Products”</strong>), as well as references and links to Products. Such Products may be made available by HEINEKEN or by third parties. The availability through the Services of any listing, description or image of a Product does not imply our endorsement of such Product or affiliation with the provider of such Product. We make no representations as to the completeness, accuracy or timeliness of such listings, descriptions or images (including any features, specifications and prices contained therein). Such information and the availability of any Product (including the validity of any coupon or discount) is subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are for convenience only. We make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of Products, including the applicable colors, however the actual colors you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors.

We neither control nor endorse, nor are we responsible for, any Third Party Materials, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, legality, usefulness or safety of Third Party Materials, or any intellectual property rights therein. Certain Third Party Materials may, among other things, be inaccurate, misleading or deceptive. Nothing in these Terms of Use shall be deemed to be a representation or warranty by HEINEKEN with respect to any Third Party Materials.

HEINEKEN reserves the right to deny any linking request in its sole discretion.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect for intellectual property:</strong> HEINEKEN respects the intellectual property rights of others. It is our policy not to permit materials known by HEINEKEN to infringe another party’s copyright to remain on any portion of the Services. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the <strong>“DMCA”</strong>) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Services infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send HEINEKEN a written notice by mail, e-mail or fax, requesting that HEINEKEN remove such material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send HEINEKEN a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/" target="_blank" >http://www.copyright.gov/</a> for details. Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to Julie Kinch, as follows: by mail to Julie Kinch, Heineken USA Incorporated, 360 Hamilton Avenue, Suite 1103, White Plains, NY  10601; by e-mail to jkinch@heinekenusa.com.  Julie Kinch’s phone number is 914-681-4100. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a DMCA notice or counter-notice.</li>
          <li><strong>Revisions:</strong> We may change these Terms of Use by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting a revised Terms of Use through the Services. Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Terms of Use incorporating such changes or otherwise notified you of such changes. Your use of the Services following any changes to these Terms of Use will constitute your acceptance of such changes. The “<em>Last Updated</em>” legend above indicates when these Terms of Use were last changed. We may, at any time and without liability, modify or discontinue all or part of the Services; charge, modify or waive any fees required to use the Services; or offer opportunities to some or all users of the Services.</li>
          <li><strong>Governing Law; Arbitration.</strong> These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY, AND YOU AGREE THAT HEINEKEN AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. YOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (“Supplementary Procedures”), as amended by these Terms of Use. The Supplementary Procedures are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820" target="_blank" >http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820</a>. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of these Terms of Use and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms of Use, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Use will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.</li>
          <li><strong>Termination: </strong> These Terms of Use are effective until terminated. HEINEKEN may terminate or suspend your use of the Services at any time and without prior notice, including if HEINEKEN believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use.

Any inquiries or complaints relating to the use of the app, including those pertaining to intellectual property rights, must be directed to HEINEKEN in accordance with the “Information or Complaints” section above. The license you have been granted herein is limited to a non-transferable license to use the app on an Apple-branded product that runs Apple’s iOS operating system and is owned or controlled by you, or as otherwise permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in Apple’s App Store Terms of Service. In addition, you must comply with the terms of any third-party agreement applicable to you when using the app, such as your wireless data service agreement. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Use and, upon your acceptance of these Terms of Use, will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms of Use against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof; notwithstanding the foregoing, HEINEKEN’s right to enter into, rescind or terminate any variation, waiver or settlement under these Terms of Use is not subject to the consent of any third party.</li>
